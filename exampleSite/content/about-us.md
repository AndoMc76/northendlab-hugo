## What's this all about then?

This is a little blog for our friends and family to let them know what we've been up to during our lockdown.

We have Sam (5) P1 at school and Freya (2) at nursery. Mummy works as a paramedic so she's very busy at the moment.

Our dad has set this blog up using some pretty geeky new kind of technology which makes websites load faster - he says this could be a good thing to learn for when he goes back to working properly.
