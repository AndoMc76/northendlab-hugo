This is a little blog for our friends and family to let them know what we've been up to during our lockdown.

We have Sam, who is 5 and is in P1 at school and Freya, who's 2 and at nursery. Mummy works as a paramedic so she's very busy at the moment.

Our dad has set this blog up using some pretty geeky new kind of technology which makes websites load faster - he says this could be a good thing to learn for when he goes back to working properly.
